# Predict-employees-more-likely-to-Quit
### Summary:
   - Hiring and retaining employees are extremely complex tasks that require capital, time and skills.
   - “Small business owners spend 40% of their working hours on tasks that do not generate any income such as hiring”.
   - “Companies spend 15%-20% of the employee's salary to recruit a new candidate”.
   - “An average company loses anywhere between 1% and 2.5% of their total revenue on the time it takes to bring a new hire up to speed”.
   - Hiring a new employee costs an average of $7645 (0-500 corporation).
   - It takes 52 days on average to fill a position.

### Outcome :
   - You work as a data scientist at a multinational corporation. 
   - The HR team collected extensive data on their employees and approached you to develop a model that could predict which employees are more likely to quit.
   
### About Dataset:
   - The team provided you with an extensive data, here's a sample of the dataset: 
   -- JobInvolvement
   -- Education
   -- JobSatisfaction
   -- PerformanceRating
   -- RelationshipSatisfaction
   -- WorkLifeBalance

### Algorithms:
  **Logistic Regression**
    - Logistic regression is used to predict binary outputs with two possible values labeled "0" or "1"

  **Random Forest:**
    - Decision Trees are supervised Machine Learning technique where the data is split according to a certain condition/parameter. 
    - Let’s assume we want to classify whether a customer could retire or not based on their savings and age.
    - Random Forest Classifier is a type of ensemble algorithm. 
    - It creates a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. 
    - It then combines votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.

  **Neural Network:**
    - Neural network is a deep structure uses many layers and nodes to predict output
